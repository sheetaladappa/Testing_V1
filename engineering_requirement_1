Here's a streamlined engineering build plan based on the requirements:

### Initial Setup & Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Set up Flask project structure with blueprints
2. Configure PostgreSQL database
3. Set up TypeScript compilation pipeline
4. Create basic HTML templates structure
5. Set up testing framework (pytest)

### Authentication & User Management (Week 1-2)
6. Implement user registration/login system
7. Create user sessions management
8. Set up user preferences storage
9. Implement password reset functionality

### Core Note Input Features (Week 2-3)
10. Build text input component
11. Implement file upload system with validation
   - File size checks
   - File type validation
   - Virus scanning
12. Create content extraction system for different file types
13. Integrate search API (likely Bing API due to cost-effectiveness)

### Note Generation Engine (Week 3-4)
14. Create base note processor class
15. Implement different note styles as separate modules:
    - Cornell Notes processor
    - Mind Map generator
    - Bullet Points formatter
    - Flow Notes processor
    - Sentence Method processor
16. Build preview system for generated notes

### Note Customization System (Week 4-5)
17. Create note editor interface
18. Implement styling controls:
    - Font adjustments
    - Highlighting
    - Underlining
19. Build real-time save system
20. Implement version history

### Export System (Week 5)
21. Create PDF export module
22. Implement DOCX export functionality
23. Build download manager
24. Add local storage integration

### UI/UX Implementation (Week 6)
25. Build responsive layout system
26. Implement main interface components:
    - Search interface
    - Note editor
    - Style selector
    - Customization panel
27. Create error handling system
28. Implement loading states

### Testing & Optimization (Week 7)
29. Write unit tests
30. Implement integration tests
31. Perform load testing
32. Optimize performance:
    - Caching system
    - Asset optimization
    - Database query optimization

### Deployment & Monitoring (Week 8)
33. Set up CI/CD pipeline
34. Configure production environment
35. Implement logging system
36. Set up monitoring and alerts

### Technical Dependencies to Consider:
- Flask-SQLAlchemy for database
- Flask-Login for authentication
- python-docx for Word document handling
- WeasyPrint for PDF generation
- TypeScript for frontend logic
- pytest for testing
- Sentry for error tracking
- Redis for caching

This plan assumes a team of 2-3 developers and an 8-week timeline. Each step should include proper documentation and code review processes.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular phase or discuss specific technical challenges?
